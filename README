This is my first try at building a RESTful web service. It uses Mochiweb as web server, CouchDb as backend and Erlang as programming language. I want to use this small project to put in practise all that I have read about REST and also to try out Mochiweb and CouchDb. If this combination turns out to be easy to work with in this small project, I may use it in the future for bigger projects that my mind thinks of every single day.
